# Yagi-Uda Antenna Design and Simulation

This repository contains the design, simulation, and analysis of a **Yagi-Uda antenna** for operation near 401 MHz in the UHF band, using **CADFEKO and POSTFEKO** software.

## 📄 Project Abstract

Antennas are critical components in wireless systems. The Yagi-Uda antenna is known for its high gain and directional radiation, making it ideal for satellite communication, telemetry, and NavIC-based applications.

The simulation includes:

- Reflector, driven element, and multiple directors
- Target frequency: **~401 MHz**
- Software used: **Altair FEKO**
- Return Loss (S11): ~**-17 dB**
- Peak Gain: **~15.75 dBi**

## 🧪 Features

- 📡 Directional radiation pattern
- 📊 S-parameter and gain analysis
- 🔄 Frequency sweep from 320–450 MHz
- ✅ Good front-to-back ratio and impedance matching

## 📁 Files Included
